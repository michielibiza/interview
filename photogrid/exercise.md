# Pictures everywhere!

Handling pictures and images on mobile may be difficult. But it’s also fun! So let’s create a camera roll similar to the one we have in Google Photos.

_P.S: Yep this is an Google Photos image from the Play Store. No need to implement the search bar and menu^^._

## Description

From a strict user point of view, a camera roll is a vertical list displaying a list of pictures. Nothing more 😁. From an engineering stand point, it’s a scrolling container that should display images as efficiently as possible, using techniques like multi-threading, caching, etc.

## What to do

The exercise consists on implementing an application that only features a vertical list of pictures coming from the network (i.e. camera roll).

Your data source can be https://randomuser.me/api/?results=500 and you can use pretty much any library you want. The only constraint is you can’t use an image loading library.

Great care must be put on making the image loading quick and ideally completely transparent (users don’t like loading…) and having a smooth and junk-free scrolling.

## Other info

Here are some miscellaneous on the project:

 - You can take up to 2 weeks to do this project.
 - There is no limimations on the dependencies used but the image loading library constraint.
 - There is no requirements on the programming language you use. Use the one you are more confortable with.
 - Have fun! You 🤘.
